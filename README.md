# A Unified Deep Learning Framework for Gaze Estimation

This repository contains the complete Python implementation about

A  Deep Learning Framework for Gaze Estimation Using CNN, LSTM, GRU, Bi-LSTM, and Transformer Models on various datasets 

Models Implemented

The following deep learning architectures are implemented and evaluated for each dataset:

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- CNN combined with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- CNN combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- CNN combined with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- CNN combined with Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)
- CNN combined with Transformer Encoder

## 3. Repository Structure

The repository consists exclusively of Python scripts.  
Each script corresponds to a **specific dataset and model combination.

Each `.py` file includes:
- Dataset loading
- Image preprocessing
- Model definition
- Training procedure
- Evaluation 


 4. Datasets Used

Five publicly available eye-tracking datasets were used in this thesis:

1. MPIIFaceGaze  
2. LPW (Labelled Pupils in the Wild)  
3. WebGazer  Eye-Tracking Dataset  
4. Gaze 360  
5. Lucknow Dataset
